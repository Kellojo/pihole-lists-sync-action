[![GitHub Action](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Action-blue.svg)](https://github.com/features/actions)

A GitHub Action that syncs Pi-hole blocklists from a specified source to a Pi-hole instance via API. This action helps automate the management of your Pi-hole blocklists by synchronizing them from external sources or local files.

## üöÄ Features

- **Automated Blocklist Sync**: Sync blocklists from external sources to your Pi-hole instance
- **Self-Signed Certificate Support**: Option to allow self-signed SSL certificates for local Pi-hole instances

### Planned
- Allow list sync
- Local DNS record sync
- Local CNAME record sync

## üìã Prerequisites

- A running Pi-hole instance with API access enabled
- Pi-hole admin password or app password
- Network access from GitHub/Gitea Actions to your Pi-hole instance (for self-hosted runners or public Pi-hole)

## üîß Usage

### Basic Usage

```yaml
name: Sync Pi-hole Blocklists
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  sync-blocklists:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Sync Pi-hole blocklists
        uses: kellojo/pihole-lists-sync-action@v1
        with:
          pihole-url: "https://your-pihole.local/api"
          pihole-app-password: ${{ secrets.PIHOLE_PASSWORD }}
          blocklist-file: "blocklists.txt"
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Inputs

| Input                     | Description                                              | Required | Default              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------- |
| `pihole-url`              | The URL of the Pi-hole instance API endpoint             | ‚úÖ       | `http://pi.hole/api` |
| `pihole-app-password`     | The admin password or API token for the Pi-hole instance | ‚úÖ       | -                    |
| `blocklist-file`          | The file containing blocklists to sync                   | ‚úÖ       | `blocklists.txt`     |
| `allow-self-signed-certs` | Allow self-signed SSL certificates (`true`/`false`)      | ‚ùå       | `false`              |

## üìÅ Blocklist File Format

Create a `blocklists.txt` file in your repository with one blocklist URL per line:

```text
https://github.com/myblocklist.txt
https://my-list.com/adlist.raw
```

## üîê Security Considerations

### Storing Secrets

Always store sensitive information like Pi-hole passwords in GitHub Secrets:

1. Go to your repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Name: `PIHOLE_PASSWORD`
4. Value: Your Pi-hole admin password

### Self-Signed Certificates

When using self-signed certificates:

- Only enable `allow-self-signed-certs: true` for trusted, local Pi-hole instances
- Consider using proper SSL certificates for production environments
- Ensure your network is secure when bypassing certificate validation

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**401 Unauthorized Error**

```
Error: Authentication failed with status: 401 - Unauthorized
```

- Verify the Pi-hole admin password is correct
- Ensure the Pi-hole URL includes the correct API endpoint
- Check that the Pi-hole API is enabled

**SSL Certificate Error**

```
Error: self signed certificate
```

- Set `allow-self-signed-certs: true` for self-signed certificates
- Verify the Pi-hole URL uses the correct protocol (http/https)
